# Loan-Prediction using Machine and Python

## Aim

Our aim from the project is to make use of pandas, matplotlib, & seaborn libraries from python to extract insights from the data, and scikit-learn libraries for machine learning and predict whether the loan applicant can repay the loan or not using voting ensembling techniques of combining the predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms.

## Data Attributes

Loan id, Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self Employed, Applicant income, Coapplicant income, Loan Amount,Credit History, Property_Area, Loan_Status

## Observations from Data 

1. Applicants who are male and married tend to have more applicant income whereas applicant who are female and married have least applicant income

2. Applicants who are male and graduated have more income than the applicants who have not graduated.

3. Applicants who are not self employed have more income than the applicants who are self employed.

4. Applicants who have more dependents have least income whereas applicants which have no dependents have maximum applicant income.

5. Applicants who have property in urban and have credit history have maximum applicant income

6. Applicants who are graduate and have credit history have more applicant income.

7. Loan Amount is linearly dependent on Applicant income

8. From heatmaps, applicant income and loan amount are highly positively correlated.

9. Male applicants are more than female applicants.

10. No of applicants who are married are more than no of applicants who are not married.

## Conclusion

From the Exploratory Data Analysis, we could generate insight from the data. How each of the features relates to the target. And, Logistic Regression performed better than other models.
